# Arrays, Loops, Imports, ArrayLists

This lab is dedicated to creating, interacting with and manipulating arrays in Java. 
Arrays in Java have a fixed size. Arrays are created with a certain size and they never 
shrink or grow. Java arrays are typed. You can have an array of integers, or an array of strings, 
but not an array mixed with integers and strings.

## Feature Task

### 5/30/19

***Analyzing Weather Data***

Use the October Seattle weather data above. Iterate through all of the data to find the min and max values. 
Use a HashSet of type Integer to keep track of all the unique temperatures seen. Finally, iterate from the min 
temp to the max temp and print out any temperature not seen during the month.

***Tallying Election***

Write a function called tally that accepts a List of Strings representing votes and returns one string to 
show what got the most votes.


### 5/29/19

***Rolling Dice***

Write a method called roll that accepts an integer n and rolls a six-sided dice n times. 
The method should return an array containing the values of the rolls.

***Contains Duplicates***

Write a method called containsDuplicates that returns true or false depending on whether the array contains duplicate values.

***Calculating Averages***

Write a method that accepts an array of integers and calculates and returns the average of all the values in the array.

***Arrays of Arrays***

Given an array of arrays calculate the average value for each array and return the array with the lowest average.


***Testing***

- Use JUnit to write at least one test for each of the Feature Tasks.
Tests should ensure that each of the methods work correctly.
